# basicImageFaceDetector

## Purpose
This script detects faces on images using opencv and Python with decent accuracy

## Requirements
+ Python 3
+ opencv 

## Notice
+ You will need to replace the default image in the top of the file you're reading off with an image you have
+ This image must be of people looking at the camera, facing the camera, directly opposite (this script may fail to detect faces if it doesn't reach this requirement)
+ This script isn't perfect, and is a simple project I made. Please do not use this script professionally, make something better (it took me an hour to create this)
